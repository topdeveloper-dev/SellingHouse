                    How long will it take to sell my house?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-neutral-900">
                    The simple answer is “it depends”. We have bought several houses over the years. This has allowed us
                    to create a great house buying process. We can even buy your house in as little as 7 days! However,
                    not every house can be sold in 7 days. Different homeowners experience different situations. Some
                    situations are more serious than others. The best part about selling to Brotherly Housing Solutions
                    is that we’ve purchased several homes in our local area and have been able to deal with all sorts of
                    difficulties. When you sell to us you can be sure that we will do anything we can to buy your house
                    as quickly as possible!

                  <p className="text-neutral-900">
                    Our process for creating an offer is very simple. We take a look at the location of your house, what
                    kind of repairs are needed in order to bring the house to acceptable standards, and how much similar
                    houses have sold for in the past few months. After we determine these 3 factors, we’re able to give
                    you a FAIR offer for your house. We try and be as open as possible with everyone. If you have any
                    questions about how we can buy your house… Please feel free to give us a call at Your Number or fill
                    out this simple form.
